# -Terraform-Multiple-Providers-Lab
In this lab, I learned how Terraform supports multiple providers inside the same configuration, how provider plugins are downloaded, how to create resources from multiple providers, how to fix dependency lock file issues, and how to initialize newly added providers correctly.
